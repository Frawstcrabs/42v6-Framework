  <command id="toggle" name="toggle" alias="disable">
    <parenthelpsection>Toggles commands and subcommands.</parenthelpsection>
    <description>
      Disables or enables commands or subcommands.
      You can specify subcommands by separating the command path with a dot (.)
      For example `&call;toggle example.create` will disable the &call;example create subcommand.

      You can select multiple elements by using an asterisk (\*)
      For example `&call;toggle example.*` will disable all subcommands of example, but not &call;example itself.

      You can specify multiple elements at once, and they will be toggled in order
      For example `&call;toggle example.* example.create example.edit` will disable every subcommand of example except create and edit.

      If a command is disabled, all its subcommands will also be disabled.
      Members with the bot-mod permission can use disabled commands.
    </description>
    <helpsection args="'path' ...">Toggles, in order, the given paths.</helpsection>
    <documentation>
      Disables or enables commands and subcommands.

      The toggle command takes a list of "command path" objects, which are basically just commands, except instead of the subcommand names being separated by spaces, they're separated by dots.
      For example, the command `&defaultcall;example create` can be toggled with the path `example.create`

      You can also use wildcards in command paths in order to affect every matching subcommand.
      for example, the path `example.*` will affect every subcommand of example *without* affecting `&defaultcall;example` itself.
      Using a path of a single `*` will affect every command in the bot. Useful for turning everything back on again.

      If a command has been disabled, all its subcommands are also inaccessible.
      Users with bot-mod permissions can use disabled commands.

    <output>
      <line id="TOGGLE_PATH_error">
        The path you gave me was not one for a valid command.
        A path should be the full command but separated with dots. e.g. `&call;example create` would be "example.create"
